# üáÆüá≥ Blockchain-based Tax Payment Platform ‚Äì Microservices System Design

## üß© Overview

This system enables citizens to pay taxes securely via a blockchain-based platform. Every rupee is traceable, showing transparent allocation to public projects like infrastructure, health, defense, etc.

## üèóÔ∏è Microservices Architecture

### 1. **Auth Service**
- **Responsibilities**:
  - User registration & login
  - Role-based access (Citizen, Auditor, Admin)
  - Token-based authentication (JWT or OAuth)
- **Tech Stack**:
  - Node.js / Python (FastAPI)
  - PostgreSQL (user data)
  - Redis (session/token cache)

---

### 2. **Tax Payment Service**
- **Responsibilities**:
  - Submit tax payment requests
  - Calculate tax (based on salary/income slab)
  - Trigger payment through gateway or wallet
  - Create blockchain transaction
- **Tech Stack**:
  - Python / Go
  - Integration with Blockchain Service
  - MongoDB / PostgreSQL (for transaction logs)

---

### 3. **Blockchain Service**
- **Responsibilities**:
  - Smart contract interaction (recording tax payment, disbursement)
  - Maintain distributed ledger
  - API to query transaction trail
- **Tech Stack**:
  - Solidity (Smart Contracts)
  - Ethereum / Polygon / Hyperledger
  - Web3.py / ethers.js
  - IPFS (for storing documents/receipts)

---

### 4. **Fund Allocation Service**
- **Responsibilities**:
  - Admin allocates incoming tax to government sectors/projects
  - Citizens can view allocations for their payments
  - Interacts with smart contract for audit trail
- **Tech Stack**:
  - Node.js / Python
  - Blockchain backend
  - PostgreSQL (for mapping payment to project metadata)

---

### 5. **Notification Service**
- **Responsibilities**:
  - Notify users about payment, allocation, and updates
  - Email/SMS/Push notifications
- **Tech Stack**:
  - Firebase / SendGrid / Twilio
  - Kafka / RabbitMQ (event bus)

---

### 6. **Analytics & Transparency Service**
- **Responsibilities**:
  - Generate visual reports on tax flow
  - Public dashboards to see real-time usage (heatmap, pie chart, etc.)
  - Filters by region/project/type
- **Tech Stack**:
  - React + Chart.js / D3.js frontend
  - FastAPI / Flask backend
  - TimescaleDB / InfluxDB for time-series tax flows

---

### 7. **Admin Service**
- **Responsibilities**:
  - Government officials manage project creation, fund distribution
  - View citizen payments and reports
- **Tech Stack**:
  - React Admin Panel
  - Role-based APIs

---

## üîê Security & Compliance

- End-to-end Encryption (HTTPS + TLS)
- Role-based JWT/OAuth2 auth
- Blockchain immutability for traceability
- GDPR & Indian data compliance (DPDP Bill)

---

## üîÅ Inter-Service Communication

- **REST/gRPC APIs**
- **Message Queue (Kafka / RabbitMQ)** for event-based operations like:
  - Payment completed ‚Üí Notify
  - Payment added ‚Üí Trigger fund allocation

---

## üì¶ Database Design (Simplified)

### Users Table
| id | name | role | aadhar_id | email | password_hash |

### TaxPayments
| id | user_id | amount | timestamp | blockchain_txn |

### ProjectAllocations
| id | tax_payment_id | project_id | amount_allocated | blockchain_txn |

### GovernmentProjects
| id | name | description | sector | total_received |

---

## üîó Smart Contract (Key Functions)

```solidity
function payTax(address citizen, uint amount) public returns (bool);
function allocateFunds(uint taxId, uint projectId, uint amount) public;
function getTaxTrail(address citizen) public view returns (...);


## NOTE The Solidity code has been tested and run on Remix IDE
